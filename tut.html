    <!-- Attribute selecors -->
    <!-- li[class^="a"] matches any attribute value which starts with a, so matches the first two list items.
    li[class$="a"] matches any attribute value that ends with a, so matches the first and third list item.
    li[class*="a"] matches any attribute value where a appears anywhere in the string, so it matches all of our list items. -->

<!-- Specificity -->
<!-- id.class.text -->
<!-- Why not to use ids in css -->
<!--  Using the same ID multiple times in a document may appear to work for styling 
    purposes, but don't do this. It results in invalid code, and will cause strange 
    behavior in many places. you'd rather use 2 classes-->


<!-- Universal Selectors -->
<!-- The universal selector is indicated by an asterisk (*). 
    It selects everything in the document (or inside the parent 
    element if it is being chained together with another element 
    and a descendant combinator). In the following example, we 
    use the universal selector to remove the margins on all elements. 
    Instead of the default styling added by the browser — which spaces 
    out headings and paragraphs with margins — everything is close together.

<p>Pseudo class</p>
<!-- A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, 
    e.g. they are the first element of their type, or they are being hovered over 
    by the mouse pointer. They tend to act as if you had applied a class to some 
    part of your document, often helping you cut down on excess classes in your 
    markup, and giving you more flexible, maintainable code.

Pseudo-classes are keywords that start with a colon. -->

<!--  :first-child pseudo-class selector — this will always target the first child element in the article

        :last-child CSS pseudo-class represents the last element among a group of sibling elements.

        :active CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the 
        user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the primary
         mouse button.

         :any-link CSS pseudo-class selector represents an element that acts as the source anchor of a 
         hyperlink, independent of whether it has been visited. In other words, it matches every <a> 
         or <area> element that has an href attribute. Thus, it matches all elements that match :link or :visited.

         :autofill CSS pseudo-class matches when an <input> element has its value autofilled by the browser. 
         The class stops matching if the user edits the field.

         :checked CSS pseudo-class selector represents any radio (<input type="radio">), checkbox (<input type="checkbox">), 
         or option (<option> in a <select>) element that is checked or toggled to an on state.
        
        :default CSS pseudo-class selects form elements that are the default in a group of related elements.

        :first-of-type CSS pseudo-class represents the first element of its type among a group of sibling elements.

        :focus CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. It is generally 
        triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's Tab key

        :focus-visible pseudo-class applies while an element matches the :focus pseudo-class and the UA (User Agent) 
        determines via heuristics that the focus should be made evident on the element. (Many browsers show 
        a "focus ring" by default in this case.)

        :focus-within CSS pseudo-class matches an element if the element or any of its descendants are focused. 
        In other words, it represents an element that is itself matched by the :focus pseudo-class or has 
        a descendant that is matched by :focus
        
        :has() CSS pseudo-class represents an element if any of the relative selectors that are passed as an argument 
        match at least one element when anchored against this element. This pseudo-class presents a way of selecting 
        a parent element or a previous sibling element with respect to a reference element by taking a relative 
        selector list as an argument.

        :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device, but does
         not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when the user hovers over an element with 
         the cursor (mouse pointer)
        
        :invalid CSS pseudo-class represents any <form>, <fieldset>, <input> or other <form> element whose contents fail to validate

        :is() CSS pseudo-class function takes a selector list as its argument, and selects any element that can be selected 
        by one of the selectors in that list.
